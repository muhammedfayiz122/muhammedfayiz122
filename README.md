# 👋 Hi, I'm **Muhammed Fayiz**
### **AI Automation Engineer | Python Developer | Agentic Systems Builder**

🚀 I specialize in building **AI-powered automations**, **multi-agent systems**, and **Python-based backend architectures**. My work revolves around solving real-world business problems using:
- **LangGraph**, **Autogen**, **LangChain**
- **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Celery**, **Redis**
- **Azure Cloud**, **Docker**, **Container Apps**, **PostgreSQL**

I love engineering systems that think, act, and automate complex workflows.
